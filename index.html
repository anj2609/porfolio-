        <p>Welcome to my portfolio!.</p>
        <p >Hello! My name is Anjali Gupta, and I’m currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering at AKGEC. I have a keen interest in web development and am passionate about creating engaging and user-friendly web applications. 
            
            I have a solid foundation in HTML and CSS, which I use to build responsive and visually appealing websites. I’m also familiar with basic Git commands for version control, and I have a grasp of SQL for database management. Additionally, I’ve started learning C++ basics, which has enhanced my problem-solving skills and understanding of programming concepts.
            
            I’m always eager to learn more and stay updated with the latest trends in technology. I’m looking forward to honing my skills and contributing to innovative projects in the tech industry!
